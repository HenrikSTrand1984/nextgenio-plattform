## 🎯 Purpose

This folder contains the foundation of the NextGenio **Quality Management System (QMS)**, structured according to international best practices and ISO 9001:2015 standards.

The quality system defines how:

- Quality objectives are set and evaluated

- Documentation and standards are maintained
- Continuous improvement is institutionalized
