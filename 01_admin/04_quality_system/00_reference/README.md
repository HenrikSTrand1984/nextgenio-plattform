## 🎯 Purpose

This folder serves as the central **reference library** for all official ISO standards and quality frameworks that support the design, implementation, and continuous improvement of the NextGenio quality management system (QMS).

The materials stored here are foundational to ensuring:

- Compliance with international quality standards (ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 15489, etc.)
- Internal consistency across documentation, procedures, and audits
- Traceability and justification of all quality-related decisions and methods
- Training and onboarding of employees, partners, and AI agents

These documents are read-only and should never be edited directly. Any interpretation or adaptation must be reflected in downstream documents (e.g., procedures, policies, instructions).

## 📘 About ISO 9001:2015

ISO 9001:2015 is the core standard for quality management systems. It defines principles such as:

- Customer focus
- Leadership and engagement of people
- Process approach and risk-based thinking
- Improvement and evidence-based decision making

It is the foundation for the broader QMS implemented in the NextGenio platform. Supporting guidance and interpretation documents are also provided to clarify application and compliance.

## 📐 Usage Guidelines

Documents in this folder are not implementation guides – they are official reference materials. To use them properly:

1. **Do not modify the content.**  
2. **Reference them** in policies, process diagrams, audit checklists, and training content.
3. Store **interpreted content** (e.g. tailored procedures) in `/01_procedures/` or relevant downstream folders.
4. Ensure **version alignment** – periodically review ISO revisions and update the documents as needed.

## 📌 Notes

This folder ensures traceability for audits, certifications (e.g., ISO 9001), and acts as the **first reference point** for any system or agent relying on verified standards.

It is a **prerequisite for implementation** of quality-related processes across all other parts of the NextGenio platform.
