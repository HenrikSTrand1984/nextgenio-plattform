## 🎯 Purpose

This folder contains all official and approved **quality procedures** for NextGenio. Each procedure defines standardized methods and steps for executing key activities within the platform, ensuring quality, compliance, repeatability, and traceability.

Procedures are documented in accordance with ISO 9001:2015 requirements and cover core aspects of the Quality Management System (QMS), including:

- Operational planning and control  
- Risk management and corrective actions  
- Documentation and version handling  
- Supplier and process evaluations  
- Review, audit, and improvement practices

---

## 📘 Usage Guidelines

Each procedure file should follow the standard `procedure_template.md` format and include:

- Document metadata (ID, version, status)
- Scope and applicability
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Inputs/outputs
- References to ISO clauses or internal policies

All changes must be registered in the **document control log**. Only designated owners (e.g. Quality Manager) may approve new or revised procedures.
